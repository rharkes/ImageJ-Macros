Folder focus, jan 2018

In this folder, a bunch of image J macros and try-outs made by Kees are bundled, along with short descriptions. 
Most of these concern macros that have been made for ImageJ-1. I separated them in 1) macros that I consider finished, although many improvements may apply, and 2) stuff in progress that I still want to keep in a central place because they contain possibly handy tricks.
